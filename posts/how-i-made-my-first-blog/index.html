<span class=post-author>— Written by Peter C</span></div><figure class=post-cover><img src=/img/website.jpg alt="How I made my first blog"></figure><div class=post-content><p>So, welcome to my first blog post. It took me the better part of a day at work to find the best (and cheapest!) way to setup a blog under my own domain.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve recently started a new job at Infinity Works (IW) as a consultant, and with all this new job energy I thought I&rsquo;d like to look into doing some things that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to for a long time but didn&rsquo;t have time.etc&mldr; Fortunately at IW we have something called the Green Room, where I am able to do some self-development projects and such, and so starting this blog on work time is somewhat justified :smile:</p><p>The initial idea here is to start documenting findings and keeping a record of my achievements and interesting things that I&rsquo;ve learned over the course of my career.</p><p>I mean&mldr; half of all the programming I&rsquo;ve ever learnt is from someone&rsquo;s blog or a medium article, so why not give back with my own take on things?</p><p>In this post I&rsquo;ll be walking through my decision making and how I started this very blog you&rsquo;re reading right now. Because&mldr; where better to start a first blog post?</p><p>There are three basic things that I will talk about today:</p><ol><li>Domains</li><li>Hosting</li><li>Content</li></ol><h2 id=how-do-i-even-start-a-website-domain>How do I even start a website? (Domain)
<a href=#how-do-i-even-start-a-website-domain class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>In my opinion, a good way to start creating a blog is to get your own domain. It&rsquo;s not strictly necessary as I&rsquo;ll get onto&mldr; But it&rsquo;s kinda fun to get this sense of ownership, and I like to think fun is a good way to start any project.</p><p>Firstly, what you&rsquo;ll need to do is to acquire a domain is to hit up a domain registar. As I understand, and at the time of writing, good options for domain registars are:</p><ul><li><a href=https://godaddy.com>Godaddy</a></li><li><a href=https://www.namecheap.com/>Namecheap</a></li><li><a href=https://www.domain.com/>Domain</a></li><li><a href=https://domains.google>Google</a></li></ul><p>I got mine at Godaddy.</p><p><img src=https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_me/review/g/godaddy-we/godaddy-web-hosting_x4tv.1200.jpg alt=Godaddy></p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that students should visit the <a href=https://education.github.com/pack>Github Student Developer Pack</a>, as there are some services that offer free domain names for at least a year or two!</p><hr><h2 id=alright-pete-you-made-me-buy-a-domain-what-now-hosting>Alright Pete you made me buy a domain. What now? (Hosting)
<a href=#alright-pete-you-made-me-buy-a-domain-what-now-hosting class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Great! You got your own domain! Logically the next step start putting content in your shiny new domain. <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, before you can do that, you&rsquo;re going to need someone to host your content.</p><p>Now this can be a bit of a sticking point&mldr; especially if you don&rsquo;t have much patience&mldr;</p><p>Basically, there are a lot of options and it really depends on what you want for a blog. In my case, I didn&rsquo;t want to spend much money, and I wanted the convenience of publishing as fast as possible.</p><p>Turns out you need to compromise a little&mldr;(surpise!)</p><p>Let me simplify the options for you!</p><ol><li><a href=https://wordpress.com/>Wordpress</a></li></ol><ul><li>Cheap!</li><li>Convenient!</li><li>Not fun!</li></ul><ol start=2><li><a href=https://aws.amazon.com/websites/>AWS based</a></li></ol><ul><li>Cheaper!</li><li>Least convenient!</li><li>Maybe more fun?!</li></ul><ol start=3><li><a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a> (my option)</li></ol><ul><li>Cheapest! (FREE)</li><li>Also convenient!</li><li>Not as fun!</li></ul><h3 id=wordpress>Wordpress
<a href=#wordpress class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>I&rsquo;ve heard of wordpress for a while now, it&rsquo;s a household name and it&rsquo;s quite consistently rated as one of the <a href=https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/cms>best</a> CMS around!
As I understand, most websites currently are powered by these <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system>CMS</a>&rsquo;s as they&rsquo;re the easiest and fastest way to deliver a website.</p><p>In my experience, I&rsquo;ve heard of:</p><ol><li><a href=https://wordpress.com/>Wordpress</a></li><li><a href=https://www.sitecore.com/>Sitecore</a></li></ol><p>And not much positive about either&mldr;</p><p>But hey, what do I know, I&rsquo;ve not tried either. And I almost considered a hosted wordpress site, since it&rsquo;s only about <a href=https://www.godaddy.com/en-uk/hosting/wordpress-hosting>£5 a month</a>. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try it one day and write a post on it.</p><h3 id=aws-based>AWS Based
<a href=#aws-based class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>I say AWS, but I mean this could apply to all the cloud providers meaning GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean to name a few.</p><p>With the power of the cloud, you can make a website in so many different ways. You could:</p><ol><li>Use something like to distribute static websites hosted on S3 buckets</li><li>Run an apache server off of an EC2 instance or some kind of VPS</li><li>Use an EC2 instance or VPS to run wordpress</li></ol><p>If you really want to get into it, you should start <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/websites/>here</a>.</p><p>If you are a bit of cloud nerd (like what I&rsquo;m aiming to be), this would be a good way to flex your skills :muscle:, and actually good fun along the way. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try this method soon.</p><p>There are also many different ways to go about it with a cloud provider, as explained in the link above. But the problem with all of those options is that eventually&mldr; you&rsquo;re going to run into some costs.</p><p>Running wordpress on Lightsail is about minimum £3.50 a month&mldr; EC2 is going to be at least £5&mldr; Cloudfront and S3 is <strong>very</strong> cheap&mldr; but still not as cheap as free.</p><p>However, you do get many pros with the latter method.</p><ol><li>You can get an SSL certificate for your custom domain.</li><li>It&rsquo;s easily the most scalable option.</li><li>You can also enable your website to act as a REST API.</li><li>AWS can also register your domain and manage your DNS with route53.</li></ol><h3 id=github-pages-and-netlify>Github Pages and Netlify
<a href=#github-pages-and-netlify class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Introducing <a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a>, which is a feature that Github has supported since 2008. Totally free, although there are some <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits><em><strong>soft limits</strong></em></a> per repository.</p><p>There is also <a href=https://www.netlify.com>Netlify</a> which is a good alternative to Github pages and it features less restrictive limits for the free version. My friend Anton showed me this <a href=https://savjee.be/2020/05/benchmarking-static-website-hosting-providers/>link</a>, which I used a basis to justify not using Netlify just yet as it seemed to have marginally slower response times than Github pages :joy:. Again, if I need it one day, I&rsquo;ll look into it&mldr; But be warned that netlify currently doesn&rsquo;t support <a href=https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/>subdomains</a></p><p>The great thing about Github pages is that it&rsquo;s so easy to setup. All it takes is to create a Github repository, and then going into the settings to pick a theme, and you will have a .github.io website in literally no time.</p><p>And <strong>boom</strong>! You have a website! No domain name required.</p><p>Although if you wanted to connect your personal domain to github pages, it&rsquo;s also possible <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages>to do that</a>. And I do highly recommend doing that as it makes your blog unique.</p><p>Github pages comes preloaded with <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a> as the <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/>Static Site Generator</a>, which is powered by Ruby. And this will lead me nicely onto&mldr;</p><hr><h2 id=halp-i-dont-know-html-how-do-i-make-some-content>Halp, I don&rsquo;t know HTML, how do I make some (<strong>CONTENT</strong>)?
<a href=#halp-i-dont-know-html-how-do-i-make-some-content class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>The <a href=https://jamstack.org/>Jamstack</a>, as I&rsquo;ve seen it called, is a modern and simple method to build and deploy a static website with the least faff as possible. It&rsquo;s how I created this website, and it&rsquo;s most of what I&rsquo;ve been talking about in this blog post.</p><p>Using what is known as a <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/>Static Site Generator</a> (SSGs), you can quite easily generate the necessary HTML and CSS for a good looking website without much fuss. That&rsquo;s basically what SSGs do; it simplifies the process of writing content as you can do it in something like markdown, and easily have that compile into a beautiful webpage.</p><p>There is a plethora of options here (as usual!), and honestly I don&rsquo;t know enough here to give any recommendations. But I would avoid Next.js and Gatsby for simple websites like a blog since I believe they&rsquo;re used more for deploying static react apps, and I wouldn&rsquo;t bother with something as complex as react for a blog.</p><p><a href=https://www.11ty.dev/>Eleventy</a> (written in JS) and <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> (written in Go) look very interesting and up and coming in terms of userbase and functionality.</p><p><a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a> has been around for longer and is already quite established, but ecosystem of Ruby with Bundler and Gemfiles feel a bit heavy for building a static website. Look at the <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/>setup</a> for Jekyll (despite the fact that they try to hide this with a nice simple <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/docs/>quickstart</a>).</p><p>Compare this to Eleventy&rsquo;s super quick (non-existent) <a href=https://www.11ty.dev/#quick-start>setup</a>, or even Hugo&rsquo;s no bullshit setup <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-2-create-a-new-site>here</a>.</p><p>I might consider moving to Hugo and get rid of ruby off my system entirely.</p><hr><h2 id=summary>Summary
<a href=#summary class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>To summarise, below is a diagram that describes the process of making this website.</p><p><img src=/img/website.jpg alt=MyWebsiteDiagram></p><p>Although this could easily be done alternatively as:</p><p><img src=/img/desiredwebsite.jpg alt=MyDesiredDiagram></p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to find out more about how other people set up their websites I highly recommend using blogging platforms like <a href=https://hashnode.com>Hashnode</a> or <a href=https://dev.to>Dev.to</a> and going to other people&rsquo;s blogs and see what they&rsquo;ve done, such as <a href=https://blog.cavelab.dev/2021/08/deploying-hugo-blog-to-s3/>this guy</a>.</p><p>Thanks for reading my first blog post and I hope you will find my future posts interesting!</p><p><em>(P.S.)
