So, welcome to my first blog post. It took me the better part of a day at work to find the best (and cheapest!) way to setup a blog under my own domain.

I've recently started a new job at Infinity Works (IW) as a consultant, and with all this new job energy I thought I'd like to look into doing some things that I've been meaning to for a long time but didn't have time... etc etc... Fortunately at IW we have something called the Green Room, where I can do self-development projects and such, and so starting this blog on work time is somewhat justified :smile:

The initial idea here is to start documenting findings and keeping a record of my achievements and interesting things that I've learned over the course of my career.

I mean... half of all the programming I've ever learnt is from someone's blog or a medium article, so why not give back with my own take on things...

In this post I'll be walking through my decision making and how I started this very blog you're reading right now. Because... where better to start a first blog post?

## How do I even start a website?

In my opinion, a good way to start creating a blog is to get your own domain. It's not strictly necessary as I'll get onto... But it's kinda fun to get this sense of ownership and I like to think fun is a good way to start any project.

Firstly, what you'll need to acquire a domain is to hit up a domain registar. As I understand, and at the time of writing, good options for domain registars are:

- [Godaddy][godaddy]
- [Namecheap][namecheap]
- [Domain][domain]
- [Google][domain-google]

I got mine at Godaddy.

## Alright Pete you made me buy a domain. What now?

Great! You got your own domain! Logically the next step start putting content in your shiny new domain.

Now this can be a bit of a sticking point... especially if you don't have much patience...

Basically, there are a lot of options and it really depends on what you want for a blog. In my case, I didn't want to spend much money, and I wanted the convenience of publishing as fast as possible.

Turns out you need to compromise a little...(surpise!)

Let me simplify the options for you!

1. [Wordpress][wordpress]
  - Cheap!
  - Convenient!
  - Not fun!
2. [AWS based][aws-website]
  - Cheaper!
  - Least convenient!
  - Maybe more fun?!
3. [Github Pages][gh-pages] (my option)
  - Cheapest! (FREE)
  - Also convenient!
  - Not as fun!

### Wordpress

I've heard of wordpress since university. Not great things, but it *was* in the context of a secure systems lab where sites running on out of date wordpress software were the most vulnerable systems to exploits.

As I understand, most websites currently are powered by these [CMS][CMS]'s as they're the easiest and fastest way to deliver a website.

In my experience, I've heard of:

1. [Wordpress][wordpress]
2. [Sitecore][sitecore]

And not much positive about either...

But hey, what do I know, I've not tried either. And I almost considered a hosted wordpress site, since it's only about [Â£5 a month][wordpress-hosted]. Maybe I'll try it one day and write a post on it.

### AWS Based

I say AWS, but I mean this could apply to all the cloud providers...GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean...

If you really want to get into it, you should start [here][aws-website].

If you are a bit of cloud nerd (like me I guess), this would be a good way to flex your skills :muscle:, and also
