So, welcome to my first blog post. It took me the better part of a day at work to find the best (and cheapest!) way to setup a blog under my own domain. By the way, at my work we have something called the "green room" where we can pursue our own projects and such for self-development, so I'm not just procrastinating at work :)

The initial idea for this blog was to start documenting and keeping a record of my achievements and interesting things that I've learned over the course of my career
